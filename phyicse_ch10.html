        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">INTRODUCTION</h2>
        The first known magnets were the pieces of <i class="w3-text-red">lodestone</i>, an ore of iron
            oxide(Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) found in large quantities in Magnesia, in Asia minor.<br>
            This ore was found to posses two properties:<br>
            i. It attracts small pieces of iron, and<br>
            ii. It sets itself along a definite direction when it is suspended freely.<br>
        If a magnet is suspended with a silk thread such that it is free to rotate in a horizontal plane, it sets
            itself always pointing in the geographic north-south direction.<br>
        Two like poles (<i class="w3-text-red">both north poles or both south poles</i>) repel each other, while two unlike poles
            (<i class="w3-text-red">one north pole and the other south pole</i>) attract each other.

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">INDUCED MAGNETISM (Magnetism induced By a bar magnet on the magnetic materials)</h2>
        The temporary magnetism acquired by a magnetic material when it is kept near (or in contact with) a
            magnet, is called induced magnetism.<br>
        A magnetic pole induces an opposite polarity on the near end and a similar polarity on the farther end of
            the magnetic material.<br>
        <b>* Induction precedes attraction</b><br>
        When a piece of iron is brought near one end of a magnet, the nearer end of the piece acquires an
            opposite polarity by magnetic induction. Since unlike poles attract each other, therefore iron piece is
            attracted towards the end of magnet.Thus piece of iron first becomes a magnet by induction and then it
            is attracted.In other words, induction precedes attraction.<br>
        <b>* Induced magnetism is temporary.</b><br>

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">LINES OF MAGNETIC FIELD</h2>
        <p>The space around a magnet in which the needle of a compass rests in a direction other than the geographic
            north-south direction, is called the magnetic field of the magnet.Magnetic field is a <i class="w3-text-red">vector</i>
            quantity.</p>
        <p>The magnitude of magnetic field at a point is measured by the force which a magnetic pole placed at that
            point, experiences, while the direction of the magnetic field is the direction in which the needle of
            compass rests when it is placed at that point.</p>
        <p>A <i class="w3-text-red">magnetic field line</i> is a continuous curve in a magnetic field such that tangent at any point of
            it
            gives the direction of the magnetic field at that point.</p><br>

        </div><br>

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">PROPERTIES OF MAGNETIC FIELD LINES</h2>
        1. They are closed and continuous curve.<br>
        2. Outside the magnet, they are directed from the north pole towards the south pole of the magnet.<br>
        3. The tangent at any point on a field line gives the direction of the magnetic field at that point.<br>
        4. They never intersect one another.<br>
        5. They are crowded near the poles of the magnet where the magnetic field is strong and are far separated at
        the middle of the magnet where the magnetic field is weak.<br>
        6. Parallel and equi-distant field lines represent <i class="w3-text-red">uniform</i> magnetic field.<br><br>

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">MAGNETIC FIELD OF EARTH</h2>
        The existence of the earth's magnetic field is based on the following facts:<br>
        <b>i. A freely suspended magnetic needle always rests in geographic north-south direction</b><br>
        When a magnetic needle is suspended such that it is free to rotate in a horizontal plane, it always rests
        indicating the geographic north-south direction.But a north pole of a magnet will point towards the
        geographic north only when there is a magnetic south pole attracting it.Similarly, the south pole of the
        magnet will point towards the geographic south only when there is a magnetic north pole attracting
        it.Therefore, we can assume a magnet inside the earth which must have its south pole in the geographic north
        and north pole in geographic south.<br><br>
        <b>ii. An iron rod buried inside the earth along the north-south direction becomes a magnet.</b><br><br>
        <b>iii. Neutral points are obtained on plotting the field lines of a magnet.</b><br><br>
        <b>iv. A magnetic needle rests making different angles with horizontal when suspended at different places of
            the earth -</b><br>
        Two places where the magnetic needle becomes vertical are called the <i class="w3-text-red">magnetic poles.</i><br>
        The line joining the places where the magnetic needle becomes horizontal, is called the <i class="w3-text-red">magnetic equator.</i><br><br>

        <b>MAGNETIC FIELD LINES OF THE EARTH</b><br>
        The magnetic field lines of the earth are normal to the earth surface near the magnetic pole and Parallel to
        the earth surface near the magnetic equator.<br>
        <b>Earth's magnetic field is uniform in a limited space.</b><br>

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">NEUTRAL POINTS</h2>
        Neutral points are the points where the magnetic field of the magnet is equal in magnitude to the earth's
        horizontal magnetic field, but it is in opposite direction.Thus, <i class="w3-text-red">the resultant magnetic field at the
            neutral points is zero.</i><br>

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">ELECTROMAGNET</h2>
        An electromagnet is a temporary strong magnet made from a piece of soft iron when current flows in the coil
        wound around it.It is an artificial magnet. <br>
        An electromagnet can be made in any shape, but usually the following two shapes of electromagnet are in
        use:<br>
        <b>i. I-shape (or bar) magnet</b><br>
        <b>ii. U-shape (or horse-shoe) magnet</b><br><br>

            <img src="ishapemagnet.jpeg">
        </div><br><br>

        <b>Ways of increasing the magnetic field of an electromagnet</b><br>
        i. By increasing the number of turns of winding in the solenoid, and<br>
        ii. By increasing the current through the solenoid.<br>

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">PERMANENT MAGNET</h2>
        A permanent magnet is a naturally occuring magnet.Since it is not strong enough and of required shape for
        many purposes, so a strong permanent magnet is made like an electromagnet using steel instead of
        soft-iron.<br>

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">ADVANTAGES OF AN ELECTROMAGNET OVER A PERMANENT MAGNET</h2>
        i. An electromagnet can produce a strong magnetic field.<br>
        ii. The strength of the magnetic field of an electromagnet can easily be changed by changing the current (or
        number of turns) in its solenoid.<br>
        iii. The polarity of an electromagnet can be reversed by reversing the direction of current in its
        solenoid.<br>

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">USES OF ELECTROMAGNET</h2>
        i. For lifting and transporting heavy iron scrap, girders, plates etc..<br>
        ii. For loading the furnaces with iron.<br>
        iii. For separating the iron pieces from debris and ores, where iron exists as impurities.<br>
        iv. For removing pieces of iron from wounds.<br>
        v. In several electrical devices such as electri bell, telegraph, electric tram, electric motor, relay,
        microphone, loud-speaker etc..<br>
