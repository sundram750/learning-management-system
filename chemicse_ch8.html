        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">INTRODUCTION</h2>
        Elements are pure substances made up of one kind of atoms and cannot be broken down into simpler
        substances.There are today about 118 elements discovered so far.
        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">CLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS</h2>
        <p><b>1. Early Chemists</b> - attempted to classify elements on the basis of their properties, nature,
            character, valency, etc..</p>
        <p><b>2. Dobereiner's Triads (1815)</b> - arranged the elements in increasing order of their atomic weights
            into well marked groups of three called <i class="w3-text-red">'triads'</i> in which the atomic weight of
            the middle element
            was found to be generally the arithmatic mean of the atomic weights of the other two elements.<br>
            Method did not hold true for all elements.<br>
            Properties of elements grouped into triads were found not to be similar.</p>
        <p><b>3. Newland's law of Octaves (1864)</b> - arranged the elements in increasing order of their atomic
            weights showing resemblance in physical and chemical properties between the eighth element and the first
            element.<br>
            Method showed odd grouping and failed to leave spaces for undiscovered elements.<br>
            Method of classification showed meaning with light metals e.g.- Li and Na but failed with heavy
            metals beyond K.</p>
        <p><b>4. Mendeleeff's Contribution (1869)</b> - arranged the elements in increasing order of their atomic
            weights in the form of a table called periodic table and stated that - <i class="w3-text-red">'Properties of
                elements are
                periodic functions of their atomic weights'.</i><br>
            Elements were arranged in horizontal rows called 'periods' and vertical columns called 'groups'.<br>
            Elements similar with respect to their chemical properties are grouped together and have atomic
            weights of nearly the same value.<br>
            Elements in the same group had the same 'valency' and similar chemical properties.<br>
            A number of gaps were left in the table for undiscovered elements.<br>
            Properties of undiscovered elements were predicted.<br>
            Incorrect atomic weights of some of the arranged elements were corrected with the knowledge of the
            atomic weights of the adjacent elements.<br><br>
            <b>Defects</b><br>
            i. Certain pairs of elements having higher atomic weights have been given positions before the elements
            having lower atomic weights. e.g.- Co[at. wt. 58.9 at number 27] was placed before Ni[at. wt. 58.6 at
            number 28].<br>
            ii. Position of rare earths and actinides - could be justified only if arranged according to atomic
            number.<br>
            iii. Isotopes had to be placed at the same position according to atomic number.
        </p>

        <p><b>5. Moseley's Classification - Modern Periodic Table (1912)</b><br>
            Modern Periodic Law - The physical and chemical properties of elements are periodic functions of
            their <i class="w3-text-red">'atomic numbers'</i>.<br>
            Elements when arranged in increasing order of their atomic number, showed similarity in properties
            after regular intervals because recurrence of similar electronic configuration takes place.<br>
            Elements arranged in 'seven' horizontal rows called - <i>'Periods'</i> and 'eighteen' vertical columns
            called <i class="w3-text-red">'Groups'</i>.<br>
            Each period begins with an element having - one electron in the outermost shell and ends with
            completely filled outer shell elements.<br>
            Across a period is a transition from metallic to non-metallic character.<br>
            Groups 1 and 2 - are reactive metals<br>
            Groups 3 to 12 - are transition elements [metals]<br>
            Groups 13 to 17 - contain non-metals in the upper right hand corner<br>
            Group 18 - contains noble or inert gases</p><br>

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">PERIODS</h2>
        Seven horizontal rows of elements arranged in increasing order of atomic number.<br>
        Period nos. 1,2,3,4,5,6 or 7 signifies number of electron shells of an element.<br>
        On moving left to right across a period:<br>
        i. Number of electron shells remain same.<br>
        ii. Valence electrons increases by one.<br>
        iii. There is transition from metallic to non-metallic character<br>

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">GROUPS</h2>
        Eighteen vertical columns with eight main groups.<br>
        Group nos. signify the number of Valence electrons of an element.<br>
        On moving down a subgroup:<br>
        i. Valence electrons remain same<br>
        ii. Chemical properties remain similar<br>
        iii. Number of electron shells increases by one<br>
        iv. metallic character increases down a subgroup<br>

        <h3 class="w3-text-red">MAIN TYPES OF GROUPS IN THE PERIODIC TABLE</h3>

            <b class="black">Properties</b> - similar to alkali metals
        </p>

        <b>3. Group 3 to 12 [IB to VIIB & VIII] - TRANSITION ELEMENTS</b><br>
        They are all metals<br>
        They lie at the centre of the periodic table between Metals[highly electropositive] on the left and
        non-metals[highly electronegative] on the right.<br><br>
        <b>INNER TRANSITION ELEMENTS - LANTHANIDE[RARE EARTHS] AND ACTINIDE SERIES</b><br>
        They lie at the bottom of the periodic table in two horizontal rows [14 elements each]<br>
        Lanthanide series - from Cerium <sup>58</sup>Ce to Lutetium <sup>71</sup>Lu [period-6]<br>
        Actinide series - from Thorium <sup>90</sup>Th to Laurencium <sup>103</sup>Lr
        [period-7]<br>
        They are all metals and highly reactive.<br><br>

        <b>4. Groups 13 to 16 [IIIA to VIA] - POST TRANSITION ELEMENTS</b><br>
        <p><b>Elements</b> - Al to Ti; Ge to Pb; Sb, Bi, Po<br>
            They are weak metals and metalloids.</p>
        <b>5. Group 17 [VIIA] - HALOGENS</b><br>
        <p><b>Elements</b> - F, Cl, Br, I, At<br>
            <b> Valence Electrons</b> - one<br>

        </p>

        <b>6. Group 18 [0] - NOBLE GASES</b><br>
        <p><b>Elements</b> - He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn<br>
            <b>Reactivity</b> - stable electronic configuration, unreactive or inert (higher members form
            compounds under specific conditions.)
        </p>

        <h3 class="w3-text-red">NORMAL ELEMENTS</h3>
        Elements in which atoms have all shells complete except the outermost shell.<br>
        They consist of metals, non-metals and metalloids.<br>
        The no. of electrons in the outer-most shell signifies the group to which they belong.<br><br>

        <h3 class="w3-text-red">BRIDGE ELEMENTS [Second and third period elements]</h3>
        Elements of the second period show resemblance in properties with elements of the third period of the next group
        leading to a diagonal relationship.<br>
        Such elements are called bridge elements e.g.- Li & Mg; Be & Al; B & S.<br><br>

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">FEATURES OF THE MODERN PERIODIC TABLE</h2>
        <h3 class="w3-text-red">i. The table is based on classification of elements using the fundamental property of atomic number.</h3>
        The 1st period has elements H & He filling upto one and two electrons in their K-shell.<br>
        The 2nd period has elements - Li to Ne filling upto eight electrons in their L-shell.<br>
        The 3rd period has elements - Na to Ar filling upto eight electrons in their M-shell.<br>
        Thus, the complete periodic table of elements is easily and systematically built up.<br>
        <h3 class="w3-text-red">ii. Easy segregation of elements in groups and periods.</h3>
        <h3 class="w3-text-red">iii. Separates Elements With respect To Nature Of Elements</h3>
        Metals including alkali metals and alkaline earth metals are in the extreme left of the periodic table and
        transition elements are placed in the centre.<br>
        Non-metals are placed in the upper right hand corner of the modern periodic table.<br>
        Noble gases are placed in the extreme right of the periodic table.<br>
        Thus, the periodic table makes arrangement of elements easy and simple to reproduce.<br><br>

        <b>Defects</b><br>
        Position of hydrogen which can be placed either in group 1 or group 17.<br>
        Position of lanthanides and actinides which do not have an individual place in the table.<br><br>

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">GROUP CHARACTERISTICS OR PROPERTIES OF ELEMENTS IN A GROUP</h2>
        Chemical properties depend on the no. of electrons an atom can gain, lose or share.<br>
        Elements in a group have similar or graded properties.<br>

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">SOME GENERAL GROUP CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
        <h3 class="w3-text-red">ALLOTROPY</h3> - Ability of an element to exist in more than one form.<br>
        Exhibited by elements of group 14 [except Pb], group 15 [except Bi], and group 16.<br><br>

        <h3 class="w3-text-red">ELECTRONEGATIVITY</h3> - Tendency of an atom to attract electrons towards itself when combined in a
        compound.<br>
        Non-metals gain electrons and are electronegative elements.<br>
        Metals lose electrons and are electropositive elements.<br>
        Electronegativity increases across a period and decreases down a group.<br>
        Non-metallic character increases across a period and decreases down a group.<br>
