        <h2 class="w3-text-red">WHAT IS A WASTE?</h2>
        Waste is any substance that is discarded after primary use, or it is worthless,defective
        and of no use.<br>
        <h2 class="w3-text-red">CATEGORIES OF WASTES</h2>
        There are broadly five categories of wastes. They are -<br>
        <b>1. Domestic Waste</b> given out from homes,<br>
        <b>2. Industrial Waste</b> given out from factories,thermal plants etc.,<br>
        <b>3. Agricultural Waste</b> that is left behind after obtaining the consumable parts,<br>
        <b>4. Municipal Waste</b> which includes the overall waste given out from the
        township,and<br>
        <b>5. E-Waste(electronic waste)</b> from electronic and electrical equipment.<br><br>

        <h3 class="w3-text-blue">1. DOMESTIC WASTE :</h3>
        Domestic wastes include:<br>
        <b>i. Kitchen Waste:</b> Several items such as:<br>
        - peelings of vegetables and fruits,<br>
        - Washing of pulses,rice etc. before cooking,<br>
        - Any leftovers in the food dishes<br>
        <b>ii. Plastics:</b>
        plastic packings and wrappings, discarded toys etc..<br>
        <b>iii. Glass:</b>
        broken mirrors, glass utensils, electric bulbs etc..<br>
        <b>iv. Rags:</b>
        a huge variety of old and torn clothes,towels, bedsheets, blankets, cushions etc..<br>
        <b>v. Paper:</b>
        Daily newspapersand magazines<br>
        <div class="">

        </div>

        <h3 class="w3-text-blue">2. INDUSTRIAL WASTE: </h3>
        Industries use raw materials and give out a lot of wastes. some of these are as follows:<br>
        <b>i. Mining Operations: </b>A lot of wastes are produced while extracting copper,
        silver, gold, zinc, iron, coal etc..Such waste are mainly called <i class="w3-text-red">mine tailing.</i>The mine tailing
        mixed with other materials can be used for making tiles, masonry cement etc..<br>
        <b>ii. Cement Industries:</b> The waste given out may be solid, liquid or gaseous.<br>
        - The solid wastes are either used in construction activities or dumped in
        land-fills.<br>
        - The gaseous waste include <i class="w3-text-red">flyash</i> which can be used in making variety of building materials like
        bricks, concrete, roofing sheets etc..<br>
        <b>iii. Oil Refineries:</b> While refining crude oil, a lot of poisonous gases and
        liquids are produced.<br>
        - Gaseous waste is cleaned by passing through cleaners and purified part is released
        into the atmosphere whereas liquid wastes are processed and suitably dumped.<br>
        <b>iv. Construction Units:</b>These produce huge quantities of waste stone, pebbles,
        broken bricks and wooden wastes. These are mostly dumped in <i class="w3-text-red">land-fills.</i><br>

        <h3 class="w3-text-blue">3. AGRICULTURAL WASTE: </h3>
        The agricultural waste mainly includes:<br>
        -<b>Agricultural residue:</b> The plant parts left after obtaining the usable
        portions.Much of these is used as animal feed.<br>
        -<i class="w3-text-red">Bagasse</i> is the plant residue after extracting the sugarcane juice.<br>
        -<b>Pesticides</b> and <b>Fertilizers</b><br>
        -<b>Animal Wastes</b> include cow dung and other faecal matter which is used in making manure.<br>

        <h3 class="w3-text-blue">4. MUNICIPAL WASTE:</h3>
        The municipal waste includes the following:<br>
        - Household discharge of excreta and kitchen washings.<br>
        - Discharge from public toilets, hospitals, hotels, restaurants etc..<br><br>
        - All this waste is carried through sewers and is called <i class="w3-text-red">sewage.</i>This sewage is separated into:<br>
        <b>Degradable</b> parts and<br>
        <b>Non-degradable</b> parts. <br>
        - Septic tanks are used to degrade the degradable part. Non-degradable part is dumped or buried at safe
        places.
        <br>

        <h3 class="w3-text-blue">5. E-WASTE:</h3>
        e-waste is the abbreviation of electronic waste.<br>
        - includes old televisions, refrigerator, mobile phones, batteries, electronic toys etc..<br>
        e-waste may contain harmful substances as well as valuable substances:<br>
        <b>- Harmful substances</b> include lead, cadmium, mercury etc..<br>
        <b>- Valuable substances</b> include silver, gold, copper etc..
        <br><br>

        </div>

        <h3 class="w3-text-blue">6. Science teaching and research laboratories waste:</h3>
        - includes broken or discarded glass apparatus, condemned machines, waste chemicals,
        animal and plant wastes.<br>

        <h2 class="w3-text-red">METHODS OF SAFE DISPOSAL OF WASTES</h2>
        <h3 class="w3-text-blue">1. SEGREGATION</h3>
        <b>-</b> means separating the refuse into three categories- <b>reusable,
            degradable </b>and <b>non-degradable</b> parts.<br>
         <b>- Reusable</b> wastes include items such as papers(newspapers, old books, discarded notebooks).
        The <b>metallic </b>components can also be separated and reused.<br>
        <b>- Degradable </b>such as organic wastes (vegetables and fruit peelings) can be decomposed into manure
        using micro-organisms. This process is called <b>biodegradation.</b><br>
        <b>- Non-degradable</b> parts such as plastics can be dumped.<br>

        <h3 class="w3-text-blue">2. COMPOSTING</h3>
        - is the process of putting the waste organic matter to decay so that it can be used for
        fertilizing the agricultural land.<br>
        - the fertilizing material produced from composting organic waste is called <i class="w3-text-red">compost.</i><br>
        - one of the latest methods is to use <i class="w3-text-red">dry composting toilets</i>, which are hygenic and
        cost-effective way of human waste disposal.<br>

        <h3 class="w3-text-blue">3. DRAINAGE</h3>
        - A proper system of drains is required to carry away all kinds of fluid wastes other
        than sewage.<br>
        <h3>TREATMENT OF EFFLUENTS BEFORE DISCHARGE</h3>
        - The Industrial and municipal waste waters are treated in <i class="w3-text-red">Effluent treatment
            plants</i> before disposing them off in water bodies. This is done in three parts:<br>
        <b>1. Primary treatment</b> consists of separation of large debris by sedimentation in large tanks.<br>
        <b>2. Secondary treatment</b> consist of oxidising the organic matter using micro-organisms producing
        co<sub>2</sub> gas and a solid precipitated material called <i class="w3-text-red">sludge</i> which can be used as
        manure.<br>
        <b>3. Tertiary treatment</b> involves removal of dissolved chemicals, metals and pathogens and then the
        waste water is discharged into the natural water or used in irrigation.<br>

        <h3 class="w3-text-blue">4. INCINERATION</h3>
         is the disposal of waste by <b>burning.</b><br>
         Reduces the volume and weight of the waste and renders toxic waste into less toxic waste.<br>
         Releases fumes and harmful substances.<br>
         Should be carried out at very high temparatures, using pollution control devices and away from
        residential areas.<br>
         The ash leftover requires much less land-fill space.<br>
         Electricity can be generated through heat produced during burning.<br>

        <h3 class="w3-text-blue">5.SCRUBBERS</h3>
         are devices to remove <i class="w3-text-red">gaseous</i> and <i class="w3-text-red">particulate air pollutants.</i><br><br>

            </div>
        </div><br>

        <h3 class="w3-text-blue">6. ELECTROSTATIC PRECIPITATORS</h3>
         The dirty air is passed through a chamber containing electrically charged plates.<br>
         As the naturally charged air particles pass through the charged plates of the precipitator they get
        collected on the oppositely charged plates and the clean gas passes out.<br>
         Used in thermal plants.<br><br>
